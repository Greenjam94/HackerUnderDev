**Step 2: Learn the basics**

Google and the internet is your friend. If you can’t take a class, there is a multitude of online resources you can use. Whether you’re trying to learn programming and use [Stackoverflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com/ "Stack Overflow") or you’re learning about basic hacking skills and want to use [Hacking Highschool](http://www.hackinghighschool.org/ "Hacking Highschool"); you really do need to have some understanding of how things work before you try to hack them.
