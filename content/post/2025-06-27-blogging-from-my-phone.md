title: Blogging from my phone
url: /blogging-from-my-phone
---

I started this blog a decade ago. A college project continued into a professional portfolio and passion project. Everything has changed from the website name and design to the writing style and content. One thing that remained the same was the struggle to consistently post relevant content.

# The problem

A lot has changed in the last 10 years, while I am still interested in hacking, I find myself split among other priorities. The new site is simple and effective, but there is no direct engagement with readers. While Google analytics shows me popular posts and some traffic analysis, I never really know what to talk about. My recent attempts, like this one, feel brief and personal instead of interesting and educational.

Alright, so maybe I dont know what the problem is... but I can focus on "not updating consistently".

# The solution

The blog in it's current form already relies on markdown files and git. To create the next post, I just need to add a new file and commit the changes. Usually I have the github repository cloned to one of my laptops and I will write in vscode. Lately, I am not always sitting down for hours on end to finish a post. What if I was not tied to my desk, or my computer? It's possible that I could start drafting posts just from my smart phone.

Github has an android app on the Google play store. This enables me to be able to review everything in the repository with just a few swipes of my finger. New content can be started by creating files, revisions and comments can be made in github pull requests, and multiple drafts can be in progress without fear of publishing incomplete work.

With easier access to the repository, I am hoping this will minimize the time spent between publishing posts.

# Try it yourself

In case you have not used git on a mobile device, I hope this inspires you to try it. Github's app has a lot of the features already available. Let me know what kind of projects you tackle from your phone!
