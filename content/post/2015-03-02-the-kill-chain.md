title: The Kill Chain

[This is an article](https://www.securityweek.com/breaking-cyber-kill-chain) about defending from attacks, but we can use it as the “7 steps of hacking”. This shows the basic categories of where we can exploit vulnerabilities. So use this for ideas as to how you can break into a network but beware because it’s also how people defend against us.

EDIT: Don’t get ahead of yourselves, if this looks completely foreign to you, keep working at things that are simpler. Learn how to case your victim, learn all about them before you strike, learn what systems they used and find how you can exploit that.
