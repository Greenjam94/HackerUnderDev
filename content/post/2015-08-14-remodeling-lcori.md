If you’ve been following my posts, you’ll know that I do some consulting on the side for some websites. LCORI is the Lake Chemung Outdoor Resort in Howell, Michigan. My grandma has been working on the board for more than a few years. She came to me asking to help fix the navbar on [www.lcori.com](http://www.lcori.com), and I was happy to help.

After getting into the code, I saw that it was a bit of a mess. There was poor formatting and only basic functionality. So I offered to remake the website, do a little bit of renovation work trying to turn a 1990s, html table based website into a responsive modern design. Sounds easy right? Well it should have been, strip the tables, include some twitter Bootstrap and everything becomes shinny. Even the database connections and php were pretty straight forward.

If you’ve read [my post](http://www.amazon.com/MIGHTIER-SWORD-PEN-ASST-4/dp/B0080IIZQU/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1439475100&sr=8-3&keywords=mighty+pen) about making the EMU gymnastics club’s website. You know I’ve had some issues with initial design and communication. This project proved to require many more months then expected. The initial redesign took only hours. The HTML was easy. I got caught on the dynamics of the listings page. Little to my knowledge, this was the “most important” part of the site, since it was where resort lots were sold. I ran into many issues with new features, and making old processes easier. Where I thought I was simplifying someone’s work, they struggled with the new process. Gladly though, after a couple meetings with the clients. I was able to straighten things out and make everyone happy. This project was expected to take a month. It ended up taking seven. That’s why I’m relieved to tell everyone the site is finally up to par and the clients are happy!
