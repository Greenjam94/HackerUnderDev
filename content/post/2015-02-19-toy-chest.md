If you’ve never played with BASH/terminal or you don’t know what Linux is. I suggest you read into that first before you get much further into hacking. Most of Kali’s toys are based off of the terminal, so in order to run them, you will be typing commands like “nmap -A http://your-ip-address”. This [link](http://tools.kali.org/tools-listing "link") is Offensive Security’s website where they have some awesome documentation about what’s available on Kali.

If you want a link to learn about terminal / Linux, try [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-the-linux-terminal). I borrowed this link from a web administration class, but the information is what matters!
