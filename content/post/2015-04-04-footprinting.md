Footprinting is gathering information about a target before attempting to hack them. There are a few ways to do it but the important part is getting the right details, What kind of servers are in use, What kind of operating system is in use, What is the deployment and version control systems in place… Things like these will lead you to what vulnerabilities to use to get into the system

It’s a good idea to have a complete idea of who your victim is before you try to attack them. The last thing you want is a surprise, picture trying to break into a bank and not knowing the security guards had guns.

Footnote: I’m not promoting anyone to do anything illegal, there is a reason why we set up an environment with our own victims. They aren’t physical entities like the bank example, but it’s not illegal to track your own system.
