*\*\* Disclaimer: While this post is about security; it’s also doubling as my homework for MI 201 at Michigan State University \*\**

Creative Breakthroughs, Inc. or CBI is a IT risk management company that was founded in 1991. Their motto is to keep data “secure, compliant and available”. They work with other companies to train them, review their security policies, and more. CBI has their own website with a blog and CBI is also on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. While they are a company and they need to focus on their business, their social media seems to be focused more on the community then making a sale. There are a lot of informative posts that explain a lot of best practices in the security industry. Why would they have blog posts about that instead of sales pitches about their services? Maybe it’s because the companies reputation as a industry leader is all that is needed.

CBI’s [website](https://www.cbihome.com/) is the center hub for all information regarding the company. The homepage hosts feeds for blog posts, tweets, and recent news. On their [blog](http://content.cbihome.com/blog), there are posts about security updates and best practices for everyone. CBI has a [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CreativeBreakthroughsinc/) page that is used for sharing posts from within the company and articles from the industry. They also advertise their programs and products through Facebook, like the CBI Academy and some of their podcasts. [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CBI_IT) is a collection of links from the company’s articles, retweeted post’s from CBI employees, and other major security articles that are relatable. CBI also has a [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/creative-breakthroughs-inc-) page, which is essentially a more formal version of their Facebook page. With the same links and recent articles but the information about the company is more focused thanks to LinkedIn’s layout

Security professionals can learn a lot from the posts that CBI put out. For example, there’s a blog post from CBI that developers could really use called “[Securing the development lifecycle](http://content.cbihome.com/blog/securing-development-lifecycle)“. The company is great as a knowledge base for everyone in the industry. CBI has had a huge influence on the growth of the industry. [TechCentury](http://techcentury.com/2014/08/20/cbi-sets-career-fair-expands-cybercrime-practice/) has another blog post about all the possibilities that are opening up in the local area thanks to Creative Breakthrough.

People on Twitter often tweet to CBI to thank them or connect articles that they are related to. For instance, CBI helped sponsor the Misec ruCTFe team this year and the coordinator reached out to them.

Another example of how people reach out to CBI is by sharing their achievements.

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-207" class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_207" style="width: 591px">[![CBI Academy on TV](https://hackerunder.dev/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-01-at-9.05.54-PM.png)](https://hackerunder.dev/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-01-at-9.05.54-PM.png)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-207">A tweet sharing that CBI Academy was aired on a news channel.

People also link to CBI’s Facebook page and [check in](https://www.facebook.com/CreativeBreakthroughsinc/likes) when they are in the area and working with the company.

By having a wide range of media impacts, CBI is able to reach a wide audience of security professionals. Outside of their website, they rarely talk about the services they provide. They aren’t trying to sell you something in every blog post or tweet. Simply by promoting security best practices and sharing what they know, they are able to advertise themselves in a way that shows just how good they really are. The company always seems to be expanding, there are job postings on their website, linkedIn, and more. There are even job posts saying how CBI is one of the leading companies in growing the local security community.
