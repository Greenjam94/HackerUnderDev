Their current focus is to share the stories of some of the members of misec. On the episode prior to this one, my friend [InfosecAli](https://twitter.com/infosecAli) shared his story. In episode 6, I get my chance to talk about my start in infosec and what I’m currently up to.

In this hour long podcast episode, I reviewed a lot of what I have done and what my current projects are. For this year, my goals are to get the OSCP and find a position at Offensive Security that is in the information security realm instead of development. Apart from studying, I’m also trying to help the Kali team with getting official cloud versions available on AWS and Azure with each new Kali release.
