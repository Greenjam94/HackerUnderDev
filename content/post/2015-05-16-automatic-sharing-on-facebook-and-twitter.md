How many people do you see every day that are staring infinity into their smartphones? How much would you bet that they are on Facebook or Twitter right now? There are also a lot of people on the internet who write interesting blog posts to people about a lot of cool thingsâ€¦ and I am one of those people. There is a [wordpress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/social-media-auto-publish/) that allows me to share new published posts with friends and followers automatically. Thanks [xyzscripts](http://xyzscripts.com/)!

Using their awesome step-by-step setups, I was able to create Facebook and Twitter applications in under a half hour that would allow the plugin to work on my social media accounts. Publishing this post is the first test run of the new plugin.

Shout out to everyone who read this because they saw the link on either Facebook or Twitter, feel free to comment below!
