Something pretty basic that I didn’t cover early on is anonymity. Do bank robbers wear masks? Unless you want the police knocking on your door the next day. I suggest you look up the [Tor project](https://www.torproject.org/). It’s a proxy network that divides your data into packets and sends each one randomly through different bots on the network.

While some may say Tor isn’t secure. You need to realize that nothing is perfectly secure. Driving a get away car after removing the license plate might make it hard to be caught but police can still catch you using the color, make, etc of the car.

If you dont want to use your home IP address or you are doing something thst you don’t want others to find then I suggest you find Tor.
