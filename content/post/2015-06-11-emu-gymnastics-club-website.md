One of my first “professional” website creations. Making the club’s website gave me a solid 4.0 in a college web design class where I reviewed the basics of CSS, Javascript, and HTML5. Fun stuff really.

What I learned by doing this project is how important initial design and communication is. Working with a client (in this case, the “client” is my girlfriend a.k.a club President) means that you can’t just look at the website and think “Good enough, ship it”. It has to meet their requirements first and foremost. A good draft means you should be able to make it once and need only a few updates, which is a lot easier than making thousands of revisions each time your client asks for something different.

That being said, looking back on your work and seeing what can be improved is always worthwhile! When I first hosted the project, the website looked decent. Most of the CSS work was custom and I was using a very robust HTML template. I went back recently and overhauled it, scrapping the files completely and using new frameworks like [twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). The new design is much more responsive and looks cleaner in my opinion. I’m getting more feedback from the club so I think they are more enthusiastic about it.
