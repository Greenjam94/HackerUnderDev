Hello everyone, thanks for looking at my last post about [OverTheWire: Bandit](https://hackerunder.dev/overthewire-bandit/). Since my traffic is about x10 my average consistently for the last four days, I wanted to write a follow up post about the next wargame offered by OverTheWire, [Leviathan](http://overthewire.org/wargames/leviathan/).

All over the exercises, they say to not post walkthroughs or writeups, so I wonâ€™t. I will do my best to promote the project without giving away the important stuff. If youâ€™ve done the Bandit challenge already with or without a group, I suggest trying Leviathan on your own. Leviathan only has 7 levels, which by myself, took me just under 2 hours.

## Shh, donâ€™t tell, here are some tips

Now the site does say itâ€™s 1/10 for difficulty so it should not be hard right? Wellâ€¦ it is if you have no idea what youâ€™re doing, so you should definitely start with Bandit if youâ€™ve never used bash before.

Remember what you learned from bandit. Cat files, ls directories, and donâ€™t forget that passwords are stored in /etc/leviathan\_pass/. There is two commands that you should read the manual for: ltrace and ln. You might need to find a website to convert combinations of only 2 numbers (well, 10 ðŸ˜‰ ) to readable letters.

That is all the help I am willing to give you guys, otherwise you would not learn anything. There is only six levels and you should be able to figure most of it our. Trust me, there are walk throughs you can google (BUT SHOULD NOT)â€¦ I will admit that I did that for the second level but that does not make it ok. It is a cheap way to get to the next level and you do not learn as much. Definitely try to do as much as possibly without looking up the password or how to get it.
