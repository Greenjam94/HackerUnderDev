title: We launched a discord server
url: /discord-launch
---

This website started out as a college project in 2015 to learn about content creation, SEO, and websites. The domain has changed a few times and so has the layout, but the core purpose has always been the same. It is important to be able to articulate, summarize, and present while learning a new topic. Blogging has allowed me to share about my professional development and community involvement. As a decade approaches, my focus is shifting to include guest authors, cross posts, and more in order to bring in those with a similar passion. I want to mentor and support those who are going on their own path in cybersecurity.

# Join Us On Discord

A blog is great for presenting completed works, but it can be lacking for a community. We need something that is more than a one way discussion, that can promote collaboration and real time responses with involved readers. This is why we are using Discord. Topic focused channels, ping notifications, bots and integrations with external sites allow for more content than is available here on [hackerunder.dev](https://hackerunder.dev). Our server was created on September 15th 2023 and will grow organically.

## Our Focus

The discord will be focused on Cyber security and ethical hacking. It already has some announcements configured to get update posts from OffSec, TryHackMe, and HackTheBox to inspire training and collaboration. We will foster mentorship and learning to promote one another in their development. Supporting other will allow us to grow individually as well, sometimes the best way to learn is to teach.
