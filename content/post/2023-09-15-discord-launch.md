This website started out as a college project in 2015 to learn about content creation, SEO, and websites. The domain has changed a few times and so has the layout, but the core purpose has always been the same. It is important to be able to articulate, summarize, and present while learning a new topic. Blogging has allowed me to share about my professional development and community involvement. As a decade approaches, my focus is shifting to include guest authors, cross posts, and more in order to bring in those with a similar passion. I want to mentor and support those who are going on their own path in cybersecurity.
