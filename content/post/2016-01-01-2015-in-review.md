2015 has been quite the year for me! For one, I started blogging about information security and software development. I added a category for hardware, but I haven’t been able to dive very deep into those projects (yet). This blog post will be a review of all of the content I’ve blogged about, hopefully it’ll be a good collection of how much I’ve grown. To prove I really am what my tag line says; that I’m better than I was a year ago.

## The Start of 2015

Last January, I started this blog for a class. I was required to write weekly posts about a interesting topic. This blog started out on [tumblr](http://greenjam94.tumblr.com/) and I’m not to proud of some of the early posts. Forget the fact that I new nothing about SEO when writing a blog post, the content was not what you’d expect from your run of the mill InfoSec blog. My blog would’ve suffered if it wasn’t for [Lesley Carhart](https://twitter.com/hacks4pancakes), thanks to some conversations on twitter, she pointed me in the right direction and gave me some awesome ideas for better topics for future posts. I learned about [Shmoocon](http://shmoocon.org/) for the first time and[ the Kill Chain](https://hackerunder.dev/the-kill-chain/). This was the starting point to my blogging days

## Borrowing from Hacking Exposed

After I struggled to find new content for each week. I started to use my blog posts as a “spark notes” for what I’ve learned from reading [Hacking Exposed](http://www.amazon.com/Hacking-Exposed-Network-Security-Solutions/dp/0071613749). For each chapter or section I read, I’d write a blog post about what I learned. Honestly, I didn’t do the book justice, I still haven’t read the book all the way through and the note book style posts gave way when the class ended and I was no longer required to write a post every week for a grade.

It was right around the end of the semester that this blog was transferred from Tumblr. It became a wordpress site for a final project in a different class that semester. I got brownie points with my professor for hosting a blog and being able to maintain it along with my [homepage ](http://greenjam94.me/)and a side project called [COGSS ](https://hackerunder.dev/cogss/)(yes that’s still under development…)

## Expanding content

As the blog posts were exhausting my security knowledge, I was running out of ideas, and weekly pots became harder and harder. This was when I opened the site to other topics: hardware and projects. This was my escape goat to get in a few long posts about websites I’ve built and wanted to show off, or programs that I’ve found that helped to make the blog better. Over the summer, I worked a full time internship and I didn’t spend my nights writing blog posts. I went from once a week to once a month, but I feel like the content was improving.

## Bringing back the InfoSec

I didn’t really start having strong hacking posts until I went to A2Y.ASM, a one-day mini-conference in Ypsilanti. I learned a lot that day and had a lot of new content to regurgitate into a blog post. Right around this time I was able to find Misec, GrrCon and a infosec mentor. It was the kick start I was looking for to get into the security community. Over the last few months I was able to have a nice mix of Infosec and Development posts where I could write down what I was learning as a hacker and I could rave about what I was doing as a developer.

## The best of 2015

If I had to boil the best down to a paragraph. I’d have to say finding a infosec community, going to conventions, and giving my first talk was the highlights of my year. Without Twitter, [Misec](http://michsec.org/), or my mentor, I’d be doing everything from books and that’s not really how I learn, I’m more hands on then that. Volunteering at [GrrCon ](http://grrcon.com/)was amazing, I learned a lot and met some awesome people. It’s something I’ll never forget. Mid-December, I gave a web hacking [presentation ](https://hackerunder.dev/web-app-hacking/)to Spartan Hackers. It wasn’t bad for my first talk but I have a lot to learn about presenting. It’s good to know though that I can teach as I learn.

## What’s next in 2016?

My goal for 2016 is to get back to weekly blog posts. I’d like to be able to do 2 infosec posts, and 1 dev project and hardware build each month. But we’ll see how that goes. I’d like to go to two conventions in 2016, GrrCon and \_\_\_\_\_\_. I went to two CTFs in 2015, so it’d be cool if I could go to 4 in 2016 or maybe help set one up. If you have any suggestions, please let me know! I also have a pile of hacking books stacking up, it’d be nice if I could read a book a month and be able to share some of what I’ve learned. My biggest goal though, since I’m graduating from college in May, is to get a full time job as a information security professional and absorb as much of the career, community, etc as I can because I really enjoy every second of it.
