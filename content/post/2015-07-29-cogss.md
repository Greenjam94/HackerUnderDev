I’ve mentioned in previous posts that my girlfriend is on a gymnastics team. I did their club website for them a while ago. I went to a meet they hosted their year and helped out as much as possible. They were using a Microsoft Excel sheet to do all of their scoring for each event. While watching the guy use excel, I got a headache just trying to follow the complex steps that were set up for it… so I had the bright idea to set up a website that simplifies the process and allow anyone to use it for their meets as well.

At first I made a site of my own design and tried to recreate the excel sheet as best I could from memory. When I completed the site, it got less then a warm welcome from my girlfriend’s gymnastics team… in fact she was the only one to say anything about it to me. So here I am, completely redesigning the site and discussing wireframes with her. I plan on redoing the site and following NAIGC rules for the scoring.

The next competition is in the spring of 2016. I hope to finish the project this summer. I’ll update this post when it’s completed.
