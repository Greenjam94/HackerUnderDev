Who’s excited for the next Chris Hemsworth movie coming out Friday January 16th?!? He’s trading in his hammer for a laptop in this up and coming action packed thriller.

Now, granted, anyone who calls themselves a hacker would cringe to call Hemsworth a “black hat hacker”. But there’s one thing I love about movies like this one. It opens your minds to the endless wonders of what hacking can do. (Please note: it’s never as easy as movie magic makes it look)

In fact, a movie like this is what first got me interested in finding a job with computers. Watching people drain billionaires bank accounts in seconds, or controlling the traffic signals to get away.

My favorite hacking movie would be *Live Free or Die Hard*. I liked the idea of a “fire sale” attack. Remotely controlling utilities, communication, and the stock market. While this isn’t really doable in the real world. It’s fun to think about what really is possible!
