I am James Green and I’m working to become a better hacker. My goal here is to share what I learned with you. Most of my projects are related to penetration testing, lock-picking, development, or 3D printing. This website will be a blog of my trials and tribulations. Hopefully, by writing about what I learn, it will allow me to share my journey with you while keeping me motivated to keep pressing forward.

## What I do

Today, I’m a web developer at Offensive Security. I contribute to some of the websites that OffSec uses to provide you with a safe environment to practice your hacking techniques. I’d highly recommend trying [Proving Grounds](https://portal.offensive-security.com), the play offering is a free tier of the labs that allows for three hours of machine access every day. At Offensive Security I am surrounded by very talented people and this allows me to learn from some of the best educators in the industry.

## History

My interest in hacking initially came from Hollywood. With movies of hackers breaking into systems and having such a massive impact to a plan’s success, I knew from an early age that I was going to work with computers. I started programming while studying at Michigan State University. I graduated with a bachelor of science degree for media and information from the [college of communication arts and science](http://cas.msu.edu/) with a minor in computer science. My degree focused on web development.  
  
I had a student job while in college working with PHP websites. This is where I was introduced to my first hack. Someone found an SQL injection bug in one of our websites and dumped the user database on pastebin.com. I quickly took to researching web vulnerabilities and how to exploit or prevent them.

My first security conference was in 2015. I [volunteered](https://www.hackerunder.dev/grrcon-2015/) at GrrCON and through talking about that I found [\#misec](https://misec.us), a group of hackers and infosec who had meetings across Michigan. When I first joined there were two physical locations (Southfield and Jackson) and an IRC server. I helped [create a chapter](https://www.hackerunder.dev/2016-in-review/) in the Lansing area and continue to help with the website. I credit most of my skills and opportunities to networking with this amazing group of individuals.
