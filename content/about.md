Welcome to Hacker Under Development where we aim to beocme better hackers. The goal of this site is to share knowledge with our readers so that they can benefit from this information as well. Most of the original content between 2015 and 2022 is focused on penetration testing or web security.

In 2023, the categories were expanded to invite more authors to contribute to a wider breadth of information security topics. Previously a student's ramblings, a log of trials and tribulations, hopefully this blog will become a centralized place of learning and community for those wanting to expand their hacker mindset.

# Our Authors

## Greenjam94 - James Green

Hello, I am James Green, the original creator of Hacker Under Development. This effort has grown from a school writing assignement, digital journal, and expanded resume into a ever growing library of cyber security information. My goal is to upskill not only myself but the readers committed to hacking themselves into a better scenario. It is my hope that by writing about what I learn, it will allow me to share my journey with you while keeping me motivated to keep pressing forward.

My views expressed on this site are soley my own, they do not reflect the views of my current or past employers.
